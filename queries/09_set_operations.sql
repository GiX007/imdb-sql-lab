-- Set Operations in SQL: UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT

-- Short Introduction:
-- Set operations allow you to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries.
-- Useful for merging, comparing, or finding differences between datasets without writing complex JOINs.

-- Main types:
-- - UNION: Combines results and removes duplicates.
-- - UNION ALL: Combines results including duplicates.
-- - INTERSECT: Returns only rows present in both queries.
-- - EXCEPT (or MINUS in some databases): Returns rows from the first query that are not in the second.

-- Simple Example:
-- (Find all movie titles either from before 1980 or after 2010)
-- SELECT title FROM title WHERE production_year < 1980
-- UNION
-- SELECT title FROM title WHERE production_year > 2010;

-- Execution Order in Set Operations:
-- - In any UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT:
--   1Ô∏è. First, the left-side SELECT query is fully executed.
--   2Ô∏è. Then, the right-side SELECT query is fully executed.
--   3Ô∏è. Finally, the Set Operation (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT) is applied to combine or compare the two result sets.

-- Important:
-- - UNION requires extra time because after executing both queries, it must remove duplicates (sort or hash the full output).
-- - UNION ALL is faster because it simply appends the results (no deduplication step).
-- - INTERSECT and EXCEPT are also costly because they require full comparisons between sets.

-- Summary of relative cost (approximately): UNION ALL  <  INTERSECT ‚âà EXCEPT  <  UNION (From fastest to slowest.)

-- 1. Find actors who acted in movies OR video games
SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%movie%')

UNION

SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%video game%');
-- (UNION merges both lists, removing duplicates automatically.)

-- 2. Find actors who acted in movies OR video games (allowing duplicates)
SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%movie%')

UNION ALL

SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%video game%');
-- (UNION ALL merges both lists, keeping duplicates.
--  UNION operations require extra time because the database must compare, sort, and remove duplicate rows.
--  Whenever possible, if duplicate removal is not necessary, prefer using UNION ALL instead of UNION.
--  UNION ALL simply appends the results without checking for duplicates, making it much faster and lighter, especially on large datasets.)

-- 3. Find all companies involved in either movie production OR video game production
SELECT cn.name
FROM company_name cn
JOIN movie_companies mc ON cn.id = mc.company_id
JOIN title t ON t.id = mc.movie_id

UNION

SELECT cn.name
FROM company_name cn
JOIN movie_companies mc ON cn.id = mc.company_id
JOIN title t ON t.id = mc.movie_id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%video game%');
-- (Finds companies active in either domain.)

-- 4. Find actors who acted both in movies AND in video games (using INTERSECT)
SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%movie%')

INTERSECT

SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%video game%');
-- (INTERSECT keeps only those actors appearing in both sets.)

-- 5. Find titles produced by two different companies (Disney and Pixar)
SELECT t.title

INTERSECT

SELECT t.title
FROM title t

EXCEPT

SELECT n.name
FROM name n
JOIN cast_info ci ON n.id = ci.person_id
JOIN title t ON ci.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.kind_id IN (SELECT id FROM kind_type WHERE kind ILIKE '%video game%');
-- (EXCEPT removes actors found in the second query.)

SELECT k.keyword
FROM keyword k
JOIN movie_keyword mk ON k.id = mk.keyword_id

    JOIN title t2 ON mk2.movie_id = t2.id
    WHERE mk2.keyword_id = k.id
      AND t2.production_year > 2000	-- (Notice that we should also use this to take horror movies after 2000.)
      AND EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM keyword k2

-- üß† Quick Exam Reminder: Set Operations Usage

-- - Use UNION when you want to merge two results and remove duplicates automatically.
-- - Use UNION ALL when you want to merge two results and keep duplicates (faster).
-- - Use INTERSECT when you want only the common rows between two queries.
-- - Use EXCEPT when you want rows from the first query that are NOT present in the second.
 
-- Tip: Always double-check column order and types must match across queries in set operations!
